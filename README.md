# BTC-Signal
The Bitcoin Weekly trend signal is derived from on-chain metrics from API endpoints that are updated daily and resampled into a weekly format for feature engineering and analysis.
The signal provides a prediction on the direction of Bitcoin's price up (Long) or down (Short) for the upcoming week based on the output from a custom TS-LSTM neural network.
The signal is integrated into a fully automated algorithmic trading system that enters orders based on the signal and 3 other market based conditions on an hourly basis.
Live trading performance has outperformed Bitcoin YTD in 2020.
Code and ATS available upon request.
